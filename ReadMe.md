# Project Description
This project is me following along with Chapter 6 of Mara Bos' book ["Rust Atomics and Locks"](https://marabos.nl/atomics/) in making a Rust [`Arc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html) type.

I've added comments in many places to help me understand what's happening.
